Sales Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of sales data using Python. The primary objectives are to calculate key metrics, analyze sales patterns, and visualize sales trends across various dimensions.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains sales data, including information on dates, product categories, payment methods, unit prices, and quantities sold. The analysis covers the following key areas:

Sales Metrics Calculation:

Total sales revenue.
Average order value (AOV).
Sales Analysis by Different Factors:

Product category.
Payment method.
Unit price.
Quantity sold.
Data Visualization:

Trend of sales over time.
Sales distribution by payment method, unit price, and product category.
Files in the Repository
sales_data.xlsx: The dataset containing sales records with fields such as date, product category, unit price, and more.
analysis.py: The main Python script that performs the sales analysis and visualizations.
requirements.txt: A list of all dependencies required to run the code.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Sales Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Reading the dataset from an Excel file.
Converting the 'Date' field to a datetime format for analysis.
Key Metrics Calculation:

Total Sales Revenue: The sum of all sales in the dataset.
Average Order Value (AOV): The average sales amount per order.
Sales Analysis:

Sales by Product Category: Summarizes total sales for each product category.
Sales Over Time: Visualizes trends in sales amounts over time.
Sales by Payment Method: Compares sales performance based on payment methods.
Sales by Unit Price: Analyzes how different price points affect total sales.
Sales by Quantity Sold: Distribution of sales based on the number of units sold.
Visualization
The visualizations provide insights into sales trends and distributions, helping to identify patterns in the data:

Line Plot: Sales trends over time.
Bar Plot: Sales by payment method.
Histogram: Distribution of sales by unit price.
Pie Chart: Proportion of sales by quantity sold.
Running the Analysis
To execute the analysis, run the analysis.py script:

bash
Copy code
python analysis.py
This will output key sales metrics, detailed sales breakdowns, and visualizations.
